        Purpose: Kalki is described to appear in order to end the Kali Yuga, which is one of the four periods in the endless cycle of existence (Krita) in Vaishnava cosmology.
Role: His arrival will mark the end of the darkest and destructive period, removing adharma (unrighteousness), and ushering in the Satya Yuga (the age of truth and righteousness).
Appearance: Kalki is often depicted riding a white horse and wielding a fiery sword.
Family: According to the Puranas, Kalki is born into the family of Vishnuyashas and Sumati, in a village called Shambala.
Other Traditions: The prophecy of Kalki is also mentioned in Buddhist texts (such as the Kalachakra Tantra) and Sikh texts
